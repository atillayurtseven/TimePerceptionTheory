# Theory of Age-Dependent Time Perception Change

We often hear from the elderly, "Time is passing by so quickly." Have you ever wondered why? Could it be related to age? Inspired by these musings, I have developed this theory to delve into the underlying factors of this phenomenon. This study addresses the acceleration of time perception with age and seeks to establish a dual foundation - both mathematical and psychological - to comprehend this transformation.

## Introduction

This study addresses the phenomenon of time perception acceleration as individuals age and aims to provide a mathematical and psychological foundation for understanding this change. The widely observed perception that time seems to pass more quickly as one grows older is the central focus. The study seeks to present a mathematical approach to explain the increased time perception shift with age.

## Mathematical Basis

Consider two individuals, one aged 5 and the other aged 50, in the year 2000. Moving to the year 2005, when the child reaches the age of 10, they have lived through 100% of their life span. This period represents a significant portion of their life. However, during the same period, the person aged 50 turns 55, having completed only 10% of their life. In this scenario, the passing of time for the older individual seems to accelerate tenfold compared to the child. This mathematical analysis demonstrates how the perception of time alters as a function of age.

## Psychological and Neurological Foundations

This mathematical analysis sheds light on the psychological and neurological underpinnings of age-dependent time perception changes. It aligns with the common understanding that novel and engaging experiences slow down the perception of time, whereas routine and repetitive experiences accelerate it. This phenomenon is rooted in the brain's enhanced processing of novel experiences, leading to greater memory retention. This study aims to delve deeper into the psychological and neurological factors that contribute to such experiences' influence on time perception.

## Conclusion

The Theory of Age-Dependent Time Perception Change offers a mathematical foundation and insight into the psychological mechanisms underlying the acceleration of time perception with age. This theory holds potential to enhance our understanding of the influence of age on time perception and serves as a thought-provoking perspective requiring further investigation.

## Future Research

This study serves as a stepping stone for researchers interested in comprehending age-related shifts in time perception. Future research endeavors may provide additional clarity to the theory and offer a broader perspective on the impact of age on time perception.
